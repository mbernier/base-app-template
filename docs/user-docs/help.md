# Getting Started with [App Name]

Welcome to [App Name]. This guide will help you get set up and start using the app.

## What You'll Need

- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- A crypto wallet (Coinbase Wallet recommended, MetaMask also supported)
- Some ETH on Base network for transactions (or use Smart Wallet for gasless transactions)

## Connecting Your Wallet

1. Visit [your-domain.com](https://your-domain.com)
2. Click the **Connect Wallet** button in the top right
3. Select your wallet provider
4. Approve the connection in your wallet
5. Sign the authentication message to log in

If you don't have a wallet yet, selecting **Coinbase Wallet** will guide you through creating one. Smart Wallet lets you get started without any crypto - transactions are sponsored (free) for you.

## Your Profile

After connecting, you can view and edit your profile:

1. Click your wallet address or avatar in the top right
2. Select **Profile**
3. Update your display name and other details
4. Click **Save**

## Browsing Collections

The home page shows available NFT collections. Each collection card displays:

- Collection name and image
- The provider powering it (OnchainKit, Zora Protocol, or Zora Coins)
- Token standard (ERC-721, ERC-1155, or ERC-20)

Click any collection to see its details and available tokens.

## Minting

To mint an NFT or token:

1. Browse to a collection
2. Click the **Mint** button
3. Review the transaction details
4. Confirm in your wallet
5. Wait for the transaction to be confirmed on Base

You'll see a status indicator showing: **Preparing** > **Confirming** > **Confirmed** (or **Failed** if something goes wrong).

## Viewing Your NFTs

To see everything you've minted:

1. Connect your wallet
2. Navigate to your profile or the **My NFTs** section
3. Your minted tokens are displayed with their images and details

## Troubleshooting

### "Transaction failed"

- Make sure you have enough ETH on Base for gas fees
- Try refreshing the page and attempting again
- If using Smart Wallet, the transaction may have been rejected by the paymaster

### "Wallet won't connect"

- Make sure your wallet extension is installed and unlocked
- Try refreshing the page
- Clear your browser cache and try again
- Try a different browser

### "I don't see my minted NFT"

- Transactions take a few seconds to confirm on Base
- Refresh the page after 10-15 seconds
- Check the transaction hash on [BaseScan](https://basescan.org) to verify it confirmed
